      <h1>My Story</h1>
      <p>I am from Ulundurpet, Tamil Nadu, and I come from a humble background where responsibilities became part of my
        life at an early age. I completed my 10th standard and finished my 12th standard in 2024 at a Government School,
        where I learned the value of discipline, hard work, and patience. After completing my 12th standard, I
        planned to continue my higher education; however, due to financial problems and family circumstances following
        my father's passing in 2019, I took responsibility to support my family instead of joining college. Even during
        these difficult times, I never stopped learning. My journey into technology started with zero coding knowledge,
        but after joining Freshworks STS Software Academy, I received hands-on training in full-stack web development.
        Through dedication, I developed myself as a Full-Stack Developer capable of building functional web
        applications. Today, my goal is to grow by contributing to meaningful projects and becoming a reliable member of
        a professional team. I believe responsibility, resilience, and continuous learning define who I am today.</p>
